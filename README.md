## Description
This project is a code refactor for an already exsiting website. This refactor serves to clean up the CSS file without changing the function of the website. This was done through consolidating like classes, Organizing classes by content they change, And adding comments to classes and IDs to make them easier to understand. Accessability features were also added through the use of the "alt" property on the images used in the HTML file. The Div elements were also switched out for semantic elements so that the code is easier to understand. The title of the website was also changed to have a more descriptive and consise title for accesibility.
